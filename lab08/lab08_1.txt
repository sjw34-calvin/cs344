Exercise 8.1

a) What does the Pearson correlation coefficient measure? Identify one example value from the correlation table you
compute and explain why it makes sense.

-> It is the measure of the linear correlation between variables.
-1.0 = perfect negative correlation
0.0 = no correlation
1.0 = prefect positive correlation
"Population" and "total_rooms" has a correlation of 0.9, which indicates a high positive correlation which makes sense
because as the population increases one would expect the number of total rooms to increase too.

b) Submit your solutions to tasks 1â€“2. Include the features you selected for task 1 and the synthetic features you
developed for task 2; include the final RMS errors but not the training output. Did you beat the Google-provided baselines?

Task 1:
minimal_features = [
  "median_income",
  "latitude",
]

Final RMSE: 166.28
This RMSE is almost the same as the Google-provided baseline.

Task 2:

def select_and_transform_features(source_df):
  LATITUDE_RANGES = zip(range(32, 40), range(33, 42))
  selected_examples = pd.DataFrame()
  selected_examples["median_income"] = source_df["median_income"]
  for r in LATITUDE_RANGES:
    selected_examples["latitude_%d_to_%d" % r] = source_df["latitude"].apply(
      lambda l: 1.0 if l >= r[0] and l < r[1] else 0.0)
  return selected_examples

selected_training_examples = select_and_transform_features(training_examples)
selected_validation_examples = select_and_transform_features(validation_examples)

_ = train_model(
    learning_rate=0.02,
    steps=500,
    batch_size=5,
    training_examples=selected_training_examples,
    training_targets=training_targets,
    validation_examples=selected_validation_examples,
    validation_targets=validation_targets)

Final RMSE: 87.15
The google provided RMSE was about 140.75 and the RMSE for my synthetic feature was about half that at 87.15.
