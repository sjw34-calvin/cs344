Exercise 8.3

a. Compare and contrast Seaborn vs. MatPlotLib.
-> Seaborn builds on top on Matplotlib and introduces additional plot types. It also makes the traditional Matplotlib plots
look a bit prettier. Seaborn also introduces other plot types that MatPlot does not have.

b. How big is this dataset and does it seem of an appropriate size for this problem?
-> There are 397 cars in this data set. The aim of this model is to predict the fuel efficiency of the late-1970's and
and early 1980s automobiles. The years of the cars range from 70 to 82 (which is what we want). In addition, all the other
features also have good variability thus making it an appropriate data set for this problem.

c. Explain what the prescribed normalization of the data does.
-> As I mentioned in the previous explanation there are different ranges and units for each of the features. This makes
training the model more difficult, and it makes the resulting model dependent on the choice of units used in the input.
It is best to used the normalized data to train the model to ensure consistency.

d. Is this an example of a linear regression model?
No it is not because there are two densely connected hidden layers, and an output layer. In each of the layers relu is used,
which means this is a non-linear model.

e. In their conclusion, they claim that smaller datasets “prefer” smaller networks. Do you agree? Explain your answer.
If we have a smaller data set and there will also be fewer hidden layers and this is to avoid over fitting.
