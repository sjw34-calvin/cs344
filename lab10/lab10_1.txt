a.    Would you rather use TensorFlow or Keras to build your models?
Keras because understanding the TensorFlow code is personally a lot more confusing for me. I also did not pay much attention
to the TensorFlow code that I did in Colab because the examples used in class were also mainly Keras.

b.    Tasks 1 & 2: Report your best hyper-parameter settings and their resulting performance on the testing dataset.
            Task 1:
            dnn_regressor = train_nn_regression_model(
            learning_rate=0.001,
            steps=2500,
            batch_size=100,
            hidden_units=[10, 10],
            training_examples=training_examples,
            training_targets=training_targets,
            validation_examples=validation_examples,
            validation_targets=validation_targets)

            Final RMSE on training data: 98.60
            FInal RMSE on validation data: 101.55

            Task 2:
            predict_testing_input_fn = lambda: my_input_fn(test_examples,
                                               test_targets["median_house_value"],
                                               num_epochs=1,
                                               shuffle=False)
            Final RMSE (on test data): 99.10.
