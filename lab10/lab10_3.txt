a.    Task 1: What does the confusion matrix show for this example?
The confusion matrix shows which classes were misclassified as other classes.

b.    Task 2: How does the TensorFlow network architecture differ from the Keras example given in class?
      Report any improvements you can make over the baseline test set accuracy for this task.
The Tensor Flow network architecture is much more complex than the keras one that was given in class.
classifier = train_nn_classification_model(
    learning_rate=0.05,
    steps=1000,
    batch_size=30,
    hidden_units=[100, 100],
    training_examples=training_examples,
    training_targets=training_targets,
    validation_examples=validation_examples,
    validation_targets=validation_targets)

    Final accuracy (on validation data): 0.94

c.    Task 3: What differences can you see between the visualizations for 10 steps and 1000 steps?
The visualization at 10 steps is basically just noise. There is absolutely no telling what the object in the image might
be. This is also because 10 steps also gives 45% which is not a very well trained network. On the other hand, training the
classifier for 1000 steps results in a 94% accuracy and much clearer visuals.
