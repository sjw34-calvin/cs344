Flowers image processing network

Deep neural networks and deep learning have become really popular in the past few years.
It has significantly improved the state of the art for many problems that machine learning and AI community
has faced for many years. Deep learning is used in many different aspects of technology such as speech to
text conversion, language translation (i.e. google translate), automated driving etc. Similarly, I also
wanted to pursue a final project that would explore deep neural networks. I am a visual learner and I was
very intrigued by the google image classification lab I did in class. For my final project I am going to
build a CNN model using the Keras API and train it to recognize flower images (inspired by Google’s image
classification course). For this image classification project, I will be using a flowers data set that I obtained
from Kaggle.1 By working on this project, I hope to further enhance my understand of CNN models. The possibilities
of using and implementing CNN’s are endless, so I feel like this project is going to be my entry project into the
AI world. I have always been interested in how facial recognition works and why it is so secure. Apple on their
newer phones and tablets has stopped using fingerprint ID and instead now only uses face ID. I hope that through
building an application that can recognize flower images I will be able to somewhat see what goes on behind the
scenes of popular face recognition systems.

The implementation of the network and the results are explained in great detail in report.ipynb. The report also includes
a bibliography page for all the external sources I used a guide to get my CNN working.
All files included in this package:
1. flowers.py
2. flower_recognition.ipynb
3. report.ipynb
4. updates.ipynb
5. results folder (this includes screen shots of the progression of my NN)



To run the network:
    1. Download flowers.py
    2. Download the data set which is stored on my google drive:
     https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LmejtB88ZLtaFIUdmPP99MLU9_HC0qG5
    3. If you have all the right libraries installed. You should be able to just run it in pycharm.
