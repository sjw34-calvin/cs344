Questions:

a.    Submit solutions to tasks 1â€“3.
    Task 1:
california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] = (
    california_housing_dataframe["total_rooms"] / california_housing_dataframe["population"])

calibration_data = train_model(
    learning_rate=0.00005,
    steps=500,
    batch_size=5,
    input_feature="rooms_per_person"
)
Final RMSE (on training data): 237.28

    Task 2:
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 6))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.scatter(calibration_data["predictions"], calibration_data["targets"])

The calibration data shows most scatter points aligned to a line. The line if almost vertical, but there are also a few outliers.

    Task 3:
california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] = (
    california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"]).apply(lambda x: min(x, 6))

_ = california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"].hist()

The scatter plot in task 2 shows that most of the outliers are less than 6. So I plotted a histogram with a max value of 6.

b.    What is the purpose of introducing synthetic features?
The purpose of synthetic features is to see how two variables are related and how those two variables affect a third variable, that you would like
to add to your data frame.
In this case, block density relates to median house value by taking the ratio of total_rooms and population.

c.    What are outliers and what is typically done with them?
Outliers are values that do not fit the general pattern of a data in a scatter plot. They are firstly identified, which can easily be
done just by looking at the graph. Then you further improve the model by clipping the outliers (i.e. setting the outlier values to some reasonable
minimum or maximum).
When I ran the verify code block down below (in the online exercise) the RMSE went down to: Final RMSE (on training data): 108.30
A significant improvement from 237.28
