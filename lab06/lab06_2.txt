Lab 06 - Exercise 2

Remainder(Hungry) = 7/12 * Entropy(Hungry) + 5/12 * Entropy(Not Hungry)

                  = 7/12 * -( 2 * (1/2)  * lg2(1/2)) + 5/12 * -(2 * (1/2) * lg2(1/2)))

                  = 7/12 * 1 + 5/12 * 1

                  = 1

Information gained = 1 - 1 = 0

Information gained is like Type where it does not give us any relevant information. The better question is Patrons which
tells us more about who wants to stay and who wants to leave.
