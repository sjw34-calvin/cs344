Email Filter Example

1) We want the machine learning model to be able to predict how likely an email is important to the user.

2) Our ideal outcome is to separate emails that have a higher probability of being important (i.e ones that the user has
responded to or clicked on a link etc) to the user from those that are spam emails.

3) A success metric is the number of important or worthwhile emails(ones they have responded to) predicted by the model.
Success means predicting 95% of the important emails and ignoring the spam emails. Failure means the number predicted
important emails is no better than the current heuristics.

4) We want the model to give a label as to if the email is important or spam. The ideal outcome is these predictions
would tell the user which emails are worth their time and which ones aren't. We can obtain examples for training data by
giving sample sets of emails that users have responded to and the ones they have ignored. These can be labeled worth while
and spam respectively.

5) We want to predict the emails importance (if its worth while to the user) in real time as soon as it is received.
The outcome will help determine the categorization of the email.

6) Consider previous emails that the user has received and has responded to. Assume that emails from that particular sender
will also be important in the future.

7) Our problem is best framed as a binary classification, which predicts whether an email will be one of the two classes
{worthwhile, spam} - when it is first received.
(This is already a binary classification)

8) Subject                Sender              Documents           Links                Output (label)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Free Cruise to Bahamas  FreeCruises.net     Zero                10                   Spam

9) We applied the labels {worthwhile, spam} to each email that was received. This was determined by whether the user responded,
clicked on a link, opened the document and seeing how many question marks there were, which the user had to respond to.

10) Sender and the number of attached documents.
