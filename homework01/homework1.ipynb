      "Introspection is one of those abilities that separates humans from machines or even other species for that matter. Introspection can be defined as the ability to examine conscious thoughts and feelings. It's like trying to teach ourselves a new skill such as learning a new language. Even without external feedback, we can kinda tell how we are doing. Introspection relies on prior experiences, we reward ourselves if we do well and penalize ourselves/work harder if we are incorrect. Similarly, I think that Introspection can be used in AI by implementing a loss and reward function. The program will learn to solve a task from a family of tasks that it is given. There can be a goal state and each time the program completes a subtask it can assign a weight to that subtask. From there based on the weights and the closer and more efficient the program is, it can adjust its parameters (kinda like we try different things/ways of learning when we are trying to learn something new). \n"
